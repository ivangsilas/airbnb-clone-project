# Technology Stack

### Django
A high-level Python web framework used for building secure and maintainable web applications and RESTful APIs quickly.

### PostgreSQL
An advanced open-source relational database used for storing and managing structured data with strong reliability and performance.

### GraphQL
A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, improving efficiency and flexibility compared to traditional REST.

- Each **Property** can have multiple **Reviews**.
- Each **Booking** can have one associated **Payment**.



## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their accounts. Users can update personal details and securely authenticate to access other features of the platform.

### Property Management
Enables property owners to list, update, and manage their properties. Owners can add photos, descriptions, pricing, and availability, making properties visible to potential guests.

### Booking System
Allows users to browse available properties, select dates, and make bookings. The system manages booking confirmations, cancellations, and availability updates to prevent double-booking.

### Review System
Enables users to leave reviews and ratings for properties they have booked. Reviews contribute to building trust and transparency within the community.

### Payment Processing
Handles secure payment transactions for property bookings. Integrates with payment gateways to ensure smooth processing of payments, refunds, and transaction histories.

### Search and Filtering
Provides users with tools to search for properties by location, date, price range, and amenities. Improves the user experience by helping users find properties that match their preferences.


## API Security

### Authentication
Ensures that only verified users can access the platform by implementing secure login mechanisms (such as JWT tokens or OAuth). This protects user accounts and prevents unauthorized access to private data.

### Authorization
Controls what authenticated users are allowed to do within the system. It ensures that users can only perform actions or access resources that they have permissions for, helping prevent privilege escalation and data leakage.

### Rate Limiting
Implements controls to limit the number of API requests a user or client can make in a given timeframe. This helps protect against abuse, brute-force attacks, and denial-of-service (DoS) attempts.

### Data Encryption
Encrypts sensitive data both in transit (via HTTPS) and at rest. This protects user information, payment details, and other critical data from interception and unauthorized access.

### Input Validation and Sanitization
Ensures all incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), enhancing the overall security of the API.

### Importance of Security
- **Protecting User Data**: Safeguards personal information and builds user trust.
- **Securing Payments**: Ensures that financial transactions are processed securely, protecting both users and platform revenue.
- **Maintaining Platform Integrity**: Prevents unauthorized access, data breaches, and malicious activity that could disrupt service and damage reputation.



## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Delivery). It is a set of automated processes that allow code changes to be built, tested, and deployed quickly and reliably.  

CI/CD pipelines help ensure that the codebase remains in a deployable state, reducing manual errors, speeding up releases, and promoting a more efficient and collaborative development process.

### Why Itâ€™s Important for the Project
- **Improves Code Quality**: Automated testing ensures that new code does not break existing functionality.
- **Accelerates Delivery**: Speeds up the process of getting new features and fixes to users.
- **Ensures Consistency**: Provides a repeatable and reliable process for building and deploying the application.
- **Supports Team Collaboration**: Encourages frequent commits and integration, reducing integration issues.

### Tools
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows for building, testing, and deploying the application directly from the GitHub repository.
- **Docker**: Provides containerized environments for consistent development, testing, and production deployments.
- **(Optional)**: Jenkins, CircleCI, GitLab CI/CD, AWS CodePipeline, depending on project needs.
